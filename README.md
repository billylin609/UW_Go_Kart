# About US

We are a team of undergraduates students from University of Waterloo System Design Engineering. We are inspired by a Electric Version of Mario Go-Kart. We are aimming to create an improved version of the Go-Kart and tackle one or two interesting problem related to vehicle dynamics. The Development follows iterative design process and will provide some insights into vehicle system modelling.
