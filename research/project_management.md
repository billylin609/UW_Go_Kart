# Timeline:

This overall goal is to complete the whole vehicle within 4 month. Hopefully finish the whole vehicle design + manufacture. Complete and finish testing 1 key feature to improve with good analysis and design.
Project ends before Christmas 2025.

# Meeting:

No required weekly meeting. Meeting is reserved for discussion on vehicle design.
Expect weekly update and weekly design review.

# Design Cycle:

- **Stage 1: Prelimary Design (Late-Sept)**
  - Brainstorming + Researching
  - Rough Sketch
  - Skeleton Ready (Dimension Definition)
  - System Modelling and concept validation (Simulink + Ansys + FEA)

- **Stage 2: Product Design (Mid-Nov)**
  - Prototype (small scale testing for complex design)
  - MVP (Prove design concept)
    - Complete Design + Design Review
    - Manufacture

- **Stage 3:(Early-Dec)**
  - Clean up & Retro
  - start new iteration

- **Documentation:**
  - Project Proposal (System Overview + Feature Overview + Dimension + Funding Planning + Timeline) 
  - System Documentation
    - Each System Need a detailed documentation and a log tracking architecture changes
    - Log for each design review
    - Manufacture Instructions
    - Testing Logs
  - Product White Paper

Simulink for high-level control level and overall system modelling.
Ansys and Solidworks FEA are for low-level Mechanical feasibility validation.
