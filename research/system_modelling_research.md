# Vehicle Modelling

- Input: Driver Inputs
- Transimission
- Power (Gas/ Electric) + Torque Converter
- Vehicle Body (Drag)
- Control (steering + break)
- Output: Vehicle Status

## Research:

**Complete Vehicle Modelling - Mathworks**

- https://www.mathworks.com/help/sdl/ug/about-the-complete-vehicle-model.html

Overview: Cover the main block for a Vehicle

**Automotive Suspension Modelling - Mathworks**

- https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/automotive-suspension.html

Overview: Model a suspension system for the vehicle

**Automotive Drag Modelling - Mathworks**

- https://www.mathworks.com/help/sldo/ug/estimate-vehicle-drag-coefficients-by-coast-down-testing.html

Note: Need some more research.

Possible focus:

- Each Component impact on system overall drag
- Possible vehicle max efficiency range
